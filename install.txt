How to install Agda on a departmental machine (we hope)
=======================================================

A similar procedure may work on any machine which already has a
sufficiently recent version of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
installed on it: https://www.haskell.org/

1. Ensure that your machine is running Linux.

2. In a terminal window, issue the following commands:

  cabal update
                         # ensures Haskell's package manager
			 # is up to date

  cabal install alex
                         # installs Haskell's lexer-generator

  cabal install happy
                         # installs Haskell's parser-generator

  cabal install agda-2.5.1.1
                         # installs Agda herself
			 # version 2.5.1.1 is the one we need
			 # (latest at time of writing, but use
			 # this version even if things change)

  agda-mode setup
                         # configures emacs to work with Agda

2.1 Cabal installs can also be done in one line:

  cabal install alex happy agda-2.5.1.1

3. Start emacs, loading an Agda file, e.g., cd to the repo and

  emacs Hello.agda

4. Explore!

(Stuart has helpfully written an emacs and Agda cheat-sheet.txt file
which you can find in the repo.)
